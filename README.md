# Description
This a try to port the project [bioengineering-11-00596](https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/ag4-digitale-medizin/papers/bioengineering-11-00596/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads) to Swift. The demo uses the CEBS SCG data of the project and Simulated ECG data created by the [neurokit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) python library. The data can be preprocessed with the Hamilton algorithm and the peeks can be detected using Nabian2018 :)
